// Prim's algorithm
//
// Prim's algorithm (also known as Jarn√≠k's algorithm) is a greedy algorithm
// that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. This
// means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every
// vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.
// The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time,
// from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible
// connection from the tree to another vertex.
